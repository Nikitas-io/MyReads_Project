# MyReads Project

## Project Overview

This is my version of the **MyReads Project** project. I made use of React to create the bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Run the app

1. Clone this git repo.
2. Go to the app folder and install project dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Aside from the npm packages that contain the components that where taught in class, also install the react-throttle package that contains the Debounce component with `npm i react-throttle`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Extra React Components

Aside from using the React components that were taught in class, I also imported the Debounce component from the [react-throttle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-throttle) npm package.
