# MyReads Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I made use of React to create the bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

## Run the app

1. Clone this git repo.
2. Go to the app folder and install project dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Aside from the npm packages that contain the components that where taught in class, also install the react-throttle package that contains the Debounce component with `npm i react-throttle`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Extra React Components

Aside from using the React components that were taught in class, I also imported the Debounce component from the [react-throttle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-throttle) npm package.
